Description: This package relies on the Windows Data Protection API to encrypt
   sensitive information using 3DES. The key for that encryption is itself guarded 
   the operating system in a secure locker that is encrypted when the user logs off, 
   and can only be unencrypted when the user again enters his or her password on
   their next login. This ensures that multiple users on the same machine cannot 
   access each other's sensitive information.
